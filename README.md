## Workflow for this project
Use Clion and Linux, please

1. If you about to implement new feature you should create new branch from **develop** branch and call it feature/[name of feature].
2. Then test your functionality (try to write auto-tests if possible (use pytest for Python and [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) for C++).
3. If you think that you have **implemented** your feature and you sufficiently **tested** it and **documented** you can initialize merge request of your branch into **develop** branch.
4. Ping other developers about merge request.
