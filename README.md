## Workflow for this project
Use Pycharm, please

1. If you about to implement new feature you should create new branch from **develop** branch and call it feature/[name of feature].
2. Then test your functionality (try to write auto-tests if possible (use pytest for Python).
3. If you think that you have **implemented** your feature and you sufficiently **tested** it and **documented** you can initialize merge request of your branch into **develop** branch.
4. Ping other developers about merge request.
